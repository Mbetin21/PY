In this repository you can find the progress of the final project of the advanced programming course.
The project is an application designed to connect people interested in learning or improving their skills in a foreign language. It allows users to create profiles in which they can specify the languages they master and those they want to learn. Then, through a matching system, users can find other people with compatible common interests to chat and practice.
